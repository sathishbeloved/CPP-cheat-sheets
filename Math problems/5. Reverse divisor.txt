Reverse Length Divisible
Given a number N, check if itis reverse length divisible. A number is said to be reverse length divisible if the first i digits of the number is divisible by (l-i-1) where l is the number of digits in N and 0 <i <= 1.

For example, 52267 is reverse length divisible because:

5 is divisible by 5 
52s divisible by 4
522s divisible by 3
5226 is divisible by 2
52267 is divisible by 1.

43268 is not reverse length divisible. Print Yes if the number is reverse length divisible and no otherwise.
Output Format
Print "Yes" if the number is reverse length divisible otherwise print "No"
